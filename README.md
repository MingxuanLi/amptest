This app is generated by ng cli and MEAN stack

You need to have [angular 2 cli](https://cli.angular.io) installed globally for the npm

Pre-installations if you want to run the app:

* npm install
* npm install --only=dev

Make sure your mongodb is open for connections

If you want to run the app:
* gulp serve
Then you can open http://localhost:3000 if you are running locally with specified port 3000 in the config

If you want to build the app:
* gulp build

If you want to deploy the app to pm2:
* gulp deploy

There are some tasks inside the task directory.

You can change the config.env inside config folder for deploying to different environments, I am running out of time to do the tests but I can provide later if possible, sorry about that.
